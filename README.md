### Getting your key and token
* [Generate your developer key][devkey] and supply it as the first constructor parameter.
* To read a userâ€™s private information, get a token by directing them to `https://trello.com/1/connect?key=<PUBLIC_KEY>&name=MyApp&response_type=token` replacing, of course, &lt;PUBLIC_KEY&gt; with the public key obtained in the first step.
* If you never want the token to expire, include `&expiration=never` in the url from the previous step.
* If you need write access as well as read, `&scope=read,write` to the request for your user token.
